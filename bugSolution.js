The solution is to clean the Android build cache and rebuild.  The `google-services.json` might be cached incorrectly.  Try these steps:

1. **Clean the project:**  Delete the `android/app/.gradle` and `android/build` folders.
2. **Rebuild the project:** Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android` again. This forces a fresh build, bypassing any cached issues.

If the issue persists, ensure the `google-services.json` file is correctly configured in your Firebase console and accurately reflects your app's settings.  Verify the file's content.  Also ensure there are no typos or errors in the `google-services.json` file or the location of the file.
